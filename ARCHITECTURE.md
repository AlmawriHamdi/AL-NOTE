# AL NOTE Architecture

This document records architecture approved by the Main Architect, the subsystem roadmap, and the stable decision ledger.

## Subsystem Status

| Subsystem | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Object System | Accepted with modifications | Defines the persistent, platform-independent page-object model |
| Layer System | Next subsystem | Will define object membership and ordering |

## Object System

The Object System defines the persistent, platform-independent model for everything placed on a page, including handwriting, text, images, shapes, PDFs, and future plugin-defined objects.

### Accepted Ownership Boundaries

- The Object System owns object identity, type identity, common persistent state, payload boundaries, transforms, and validation contracts.
- Object types own intrinsic geometry, payload validation, and schema migrations.
- The Layer System owns membership and ordering.
- The Drawing Renderer owns rendering execution.
- The Hit-Testing System owns hit-testing execution.
- The Storage System owns encoding, decoding, and migration orchestration.
- The Command System will later own applying and reversing object replacements.
- The Plugin System will later own plugin loading, trust, permissions, and registration lifecycle.

The detailed Object System architecture is recorded in [lib/documents/objects/README.md](lib/documents/objects/README.md).

## Decision Ledger

| ID | Subsystem | Decision | Status | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-006 | Objects | Page objects use a small persistent model with external behavior registries | Accepted | Documents |
| D-007 | Objects | Object IDs are document-unique UUIDs and types use namespaced strings | Accepted | D-006 |
| D-008 | Objects | Edits replace immutable-facing revisions; structural sharing is allowed | Accepted | D-006 |
| D-009 | Objects | Layers exclusively own object membership and ordering | Accepted | D-006 |
| D-010 | Objects | Intrinsic geometry combines with a local-to-page transform | Accepted | Geometry |
| D-011 | Objects | Unknown objects remain inert, preserved, and safely represented | Accepted | Storage, Plugins |
| D-012 | Objects | Rendering and hit-testing use registries separate from the core Object Registry | Accepted | Drawing |
| D-013 | Objects | Duplicated objects receive new IDs and remap internal references | Accepted | Clipboard, Commands |
| D-014 | Objects | Full grouping ownership and structure are deferred | Deferred | Layers, Selection |

## Deferred Object System Questions

- Exact transform encoding
- Numeric precision and coordinate limits
- Common metadata fields
- Group ownership and nesting
- Image and PDF resource references
- Exact serialization format
- Plugin packaging and security
- Synchronization provenance

## Roadmap

The Layer System is the next subsystem.
