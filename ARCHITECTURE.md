# AL NOTE Architecture

This document records architecture approved by the Main Architect, the subsystem roadmap, and the stable decision ledger.

## Subsystem Status

| Subsystem | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Object System | Accepted with modifications | Defines the persistent, platform-independent page-object model |
| Layer System | Accepted with modifications | Owns layer structure, object membership, and ordering |
| Selection and Transform System | Accepted with modifications | Owns temporary page-scoped selection and transform previews |
| Command, Undo, and Redo System | Accepted with modifications | Exclusively coordinates persistent mutations and session history |
| Storage, Serialization, and AL NOTE File Format | Next subsystem | Will own persistent encoding, resources, and file structure |

## Object System

The Object System defines the persistent, platform-independent model for everything placed on a page, including handwriting, text, images, shapes, PDFs, and future plugin-defined objects.

### Accepted Ownership Boundaries

- The Object System owns object identity, type identity, common persistent state, payload boundaries, transforms, and validation contracts.
- Object types own intrinsic geometry, payload validation, and schema migrations.
- The Layer System owns membership and ordering.
- The Drawing Renderer owns rendering execution.
- The Hit-Testing System owns hit-testing execution.
- The Storage System owns encoding, decoding, and migration orchestration.
- The Command System will later own applying and reversing object replacements.
- The Plugin System will later own plugin loading, trust, permissions, and registration lifecycle.

The detailed Object System architecture is recorded in [lib/documents/objects/README.md](lib/documents/objects/README.md).

## Layer System

The Layer System provides the authoritative structure:

**Page → ordered layers → ordered objects**

### Accepted Ownership Boundaries

- The Layer System owns layer identity and persistent common state.
- Pages exclusively own their ordered layers.
- Layers directly own their ordered object values.
- The Layer System owns layer order and object order within layers.
- It owns safe object movement between layers.
- It owns effective layer visibility and locking.
- It owns layer lifecycle and validation.
- It does not own rendering, selection interaction, undo history, storage encoding, plugin loading, or UI state.

The detailed Layer System architecture is recorded in [lib/documents/layers/README.md](lib/documents/layers/README.md).

## Selection and Transform System

The Selection and Transform System provides temporary, page-scoped selection and transformation without placing interaction state inside persistent document objects.

### Accepted Ownership Boundaries

- It resolves point, rectangle, and lasso selection.
- It owns temporary page-editing selection state.
- It calculates selection geometry and interaction overlays.
- It previews movement, resizing, and rotation without mutating persistent documents.
- It enforces capabilities, visibility, locking, and Page boundaries.
- It prepares atomic requests for the future Command System.
- It supports whole-object and handwriting-stroke sub-target selection.
- It does not own persistent document mutation.
- Documents must not depend on Selection.

The detailed Selection and Transform System architecture is recorded in [lib/drawing/selection/README.md](lib/drawing/selection/README.md).

## Command, Undo, and Redo System

The Command, Undo, and Redo System is the only normal path for changing persistent AL NOTE document state.

### Accepted Ownership Boundaries

- A document-scoped mutation coordinator exclusively publishes persistent state.
- It owns Command Request and Prepared Transaction contracts.
- It owns final validation inside the serialized mutation boundary.
- It owns atomic document-root publication.
- It owns session-only linear undo and redo history.
- It owns scoped revision tracking and stale-request detection.
- It owns committed-change descriptions.
- It tracks session content-state identities for dirty-state comparison.
- It retains history references to resources without owning physical resource storage.
- External effects and asynchronous preparation occur outside reversible domain commands.

The detailed Command, Undo, and Redo architecture is recorded in [lib/documents/commands/README.md](lib/documents/commands/README.md).

## Open-Source Record

- Rnote is GPL-3.0-or-later; adapt relevant retained-document concepts only.
- Xournal++ is GPL-2.0-or-later; concepts may be studied, but direct reuse requires file and dependency auditing.
- Krita provides useful layer concepts, but its node system is too complex for AL NOTE.
- Dart `built_collection` may be evaluated behind AL NOTE-owned interfaces but must not become a permanent serialized contract.

## Deferred Selection and Transform Questions

- Other sub-object editing types
- Custom pivots
- Snapping and alignment guides
- Direction-dependent rectangle selection
- Overlap cycling
- Group selection behavior
- Reflection
- Skew
- Perspective transforms
- Exact transform serialization
- Exact revision and stale-state token mechanism
- Read-only inspection ownership

## Selection and Transform Open-Source Record

- Rnote is GPL-3.0-or-later; adapt note-oriented selection concepts.
- Xournal++ is GPL-2.0-or-later; direct reuse requires file and dependency auditing.
- Krita provides useful transform-session and preview concepts, but its advanced transformation scope is excessive for AL NOTE.
- Flutter transformation primitives may support viewport and temporary UI mechanics but do not replace the document Selection System.
- Dart `vector_math` may be reused behind AL NOTE-controlled transform validation contracts.

## Deferred Command, Undo, and Redo Questions

- Cross-document atomicity
- Collaboration rebasing
- Persistent or disk-backed history
- Crash-recovery journal format
- Exact resource storage and reclamation strategy
- Immutable collection dependency
- Very-large-command spill policy
- Persistent content fingerprint
- Exact revision implementation

## Command, Undo, and Redo Open-Source Record

- Rnote is GPL-3.0-or-later; adapt command and history concepts only.
- Xournal++ is GPL-2.0-or-later; direct reuse requires file and dependency auditing.
- Krita provides useful history, merging, and memory-limit concepts but is substantially more complex.
- The Dart `undo` package is Apache-2.0 but is unsuitable as AL NOTE’s command core.
- `built_collection` remains a benchmarking candidate.
- `fast_immutable_collections` is BSD-2-Clause and remains a benchmarking candidate.
- No command or immutable-collection dependency is accepted yet.

## Roadmap

The Storage, Serialization, and AL NOTE File Format subsystem is next.
